## 📘 Thesis Summary

The thesis investigates metabolic oscillations in yeast using time-lapse fluorescence imaging data. Several modeling approaches are compared for their ability to reconstruct and predict dynamics, including:

- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
- Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)
- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)

The models are trained and evaluated on experimental data from Wüstner et al. (SDU), specifically intensity traces related to NAD(P)H metabolism under varying glucose conditions.
